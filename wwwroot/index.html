              <p>Hey there Rideshare passengers and welcome to Digital Seat!</p>
              <p>We are a DFW based media agency that specializes in creating interactive experiences for various industries from rideshare passengers to sports fans and beyond.</p>
              <p>We are huge believers in privacy, which means that we WILL NOT sell/donate/loan any of your identifiable information to any 3rd party marketing firms (we think that is as annoying as you do). We want you to enjoy using our platform without having to worry about your data being shared amongst the sprawling landscape of the internet. If you see an ad that you like, then give it a look, (that’s what helps us keep the lights at the office on and allows us to give our users cool free stuff!) and let us know if there is anything we could do to make the platform better.</p>
              <p>Thanks again for using Digital Seat. We’re really happy to have you here!</p>
